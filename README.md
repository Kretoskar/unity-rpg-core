# Unity RPG Core
Android RPG game. Started as a project for one of the courses, but I expanded it a lot later. 

Functionalities: Joystick player controller, Enemies AI capable of path finding and attacking the player, 
Player progression system, allowing him to spend stat points on abilities every level, Equipment with visible changes on player character,
saving to binary files. 

Thanks to the use of nested prefabs and scriptable objects, the project is designer friendly and open for extensions.
